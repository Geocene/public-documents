Your privacy is critically important to us. At Geocene, we have a few fundamental principles:

*   We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
*   We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
*   We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is stored or permanently deleted.
*   We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

*   Our websites (including geocene.com, studies.geocene.com, and collect.geocene.com);
*   Our mobile applications (including the Geocene mobile app for Android and iOS);
*   Our other Geocene products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites

Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

### Creative Commons Sharealike License

We’ve adapted this policy from the automattic.com privacy policy under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on [Github](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic). 

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in two ways: if and when you provide information to us, and automatically through operating our Services. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

*   **Basic Account Information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a studies.geocene.com account to provide an email address along with a username or name, and that’s it. You may provide us with more information -- like your address and other information you want to share -- but we don’t require that information to create a geocene.com account.
*   **Billing and Contact Information:** If you buy something from us–a subscription to a studies.geocene.com plan for example, you will provide additional personal and payment information, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
*   **Content Information:** Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and submitted content (such as for your study information or your survey questions).
*   **Communications with Us (Hi There!):** You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with us about a support question, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, geocene.com form, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications. 

#### _Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect some information automatically:

*   **Log Information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your website on geocene.com.
*   **Usage Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our studies.geocene.com –in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., \[studies.geocene.com username\] deleted “\[mission]” at \[time/date\]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at studies.geocene.com, and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.
*   **Location Information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you create a Mission with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.
*   **Stored Information:** We may store and access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. This information will only be downloaded from, and uploaded to, Geocene and its subdomains.
*   **Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Geocene uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our [Cookie Policy](http://www.automattic.com/cookies).

### How and Why We Use Information

#### _Purposes for Using Information_

We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:

*   To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, charge you for any of our paid Services, or provide essays and stories for your reading pleasure through Longreads;
*   To further develop and improve our Services–for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;
*   To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
*   To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition--for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;
*   To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Geocene and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services;
*   To communicate with you. For example, we may email you to solicit your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Geocene; text you to verify your payment; or call you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (Please keep in mind that even if you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account); and

#### _Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information_

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account--for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information -- for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent--for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our [Cookie Policy](http://www.automattic.com/cookies).

### Sharing Information

#### _How We Share Information_

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

*   **Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
*   **Third Party Vendors:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Geocene), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g. our [Cookie Policy](https://automattic.com/cookies/)).
*   **Legal and Regulatory Requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about Geocene.com users, please see our [Legal Guidelines](https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/).
*   **Business Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Geocene goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
*   **With Your Consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as to export your data from studies.geocene.com.
*   **Aggregated or De-Identified Information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
*   **Published Support Requests:** And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it--which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information--and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic’s websites, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Geocene’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites. 

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. 

### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

*   **Limit the Information that You Provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.
*   **Limit Access to Information on Your Mobile Device:** Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you do so, you may not be able to use certain features (like marking  a location on a Mission, for example).
*   **Opt-Out of Marketing Communications:** You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
*   **Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:** At this time, Geocene does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can [usually choose](https://automattic.com/cookies/#controlling-cookies) to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Geocene’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Geocene’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
*   **Close Your Account:** While we’d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can close your account by contacting us. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above--for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.

### Your Rights

If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:

*   Request access to your personal data;
*   Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
*   Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
*   Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
*   Request portability of your personal data.

You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us. EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.


### How to Reach Us

If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please [contact us](mailto:develop@geocene.com).

### Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)

#### _Transferring Information_

Because Geocene’s Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:

*   In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome); or
*   In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.

You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.


### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Geocene may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Geocene encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage, or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy. 


That’s it! Thanks for reading.
